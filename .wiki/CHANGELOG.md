# Changelog

All notable repository-level changes are documented here.

## Unreleased

1. Root structure policy locked to private control planes, app roots (`backend`, `frontend`), automation (`.github`), and public wiki (`.wiki`).
2. Public wiki source moved from `/docs` to `/.wiki`.
3. Planning and execution controls were hardened for Plan09 governance (`v0.1` -> `v0.9`) with strict CR/QA evidence requirements.
