# 00 - Getting Started

## Purpose

Get contributors and operators productive quickly with the correct scope and boundaries.

## Step 1 - Understand Repository Scope

1. `nself-family` is the primary `ɳFamily` repo.
2. `frontend/chat` and `frontend/tv` are integration shells only.
3. Full `ɳChat` and `ɳTV` runtimes are owned by external repos.

## Step 2 - Read Core Docs

1. [Home](Home.md)
2. [TOC](TOC.md)
3. [Project Overview](01-Project-Overview.md)
4. [Architecture Reference](03-Architecture-Reference.md)
5. [Setup and Configuration](42-Setup-and-Configuration.md)
6. [Ecosystem Apps and Shared Backend](40-Ecosystem-Apps-and-Shared-Backend.md)

## Step 3 - Environment Checklist

1. `ɳSelf` CLI is installed.
2. Local backend dependencies are available.
3. Required local secrets are configured via `.env` files (not committed).
4. Public/private boundaries are understood (`/.wiki` public, hidden control planes private).

## Step 4 - Execution Model

1. Follow phased release path `v0.1` through `v0.9`.
2. Do not start feature work before structure/setup gates are complete.
3. Treat all backend architecture as `ɳSelf` CLI + plugin model.

## Step 5 - Release Navigation

1. [Roadmap and Backlog](13-Roadmap-Backlog.md)
2. [Releases Index](43-Releases-Index.md)
3. [Release Page Template](44-Release-Page-Template.md)
