# 45 - Branding and Naming

## Canonical Brand Display Names

1. `ɳSelf`
2. `ɳFamily`
3. `ɳChat`
4. `ɳTV`

## Canonical Technical Identifiers (ASCII Only)

1. `nself`
2. `nself-family`
3. `nself-chat`
4. `nself-tv`

## Hard Rules

1. Never rename technical repository/path identifiers.
2. Use brand display names in product-facing prose.
3. Use technical identifiers in paths, code, package names, environment variables, and CI configuration.
4. Never mix stylized branding into code identifiers or filesystem names.
